  What should we call the pocketable computers that we now carry?

What should we call the "phone"?
================================

These devices that we are now carrying around have ceased to be phones. Calling
them phones is becoming anachronistic. An increasing amount of us don't really
use them for making voice calls. SMS messages are now only one of the options
that we use for sending people an instant message. Text conversations carry
over from laptop to desktop to phone.

In the UK there is a business called `The Carphone Warehouse
<http://www.carphonewarehouse.com/>`_
which now sells personal computing devices. They have no carphones for sale at
all. As a programmer this seems like a horribly misnamed constant. I would
hate this to happen to our phones as well. Let us not be the lexical victims
of history.

I think the primary contender is probably "mobile". It is already in use and
will most likely win. It is quite descriptive and a good fit for networked
computing devices that fit into a pocket. However I have always liked "cell".

I like cell, coming from the abbreviation of cellular phone. Sure most devices
aren't restricted to the 8 cell antennas anymore but the word is nice. And cell
implies communication. It says that each device is a smaller part of a greater
whole.  It doesn't have as much generic meaning as "mobile". Seeing as most
computing devices are pretty mobile. A cell is something that is small. Not
just something that can be lugged around.

But anything is better than continuing to call them "phones". Or, dear god,
starting to call them "comms devices."

**Update:** Smartphone still contains the word phone and sounds infantile. To me it
is the equivalent of calling a desktop computer a smart-space-heater.
