  Updated letter frequency analysis for English

Letter frequency analysis for the English language
==================================================

When I was a kid I loved solving books full of puzzle ciphers. Not entirely
sure who used to even publish them? Perhaps `Usborne? <http://www.usborne.com/>`_

Well the first (and usually only) attack required was frequency analysis.
Which is a pretty simple matter of counting the number of times each
symbol appears and comparing that with the standard distribution that I had
learnt somewhere.

Well apparently that standard distribution was worked out by a guy called Mark
Mayzner in the 60s and in an extremely manual fashion.

Well Peter Norvig (Director of Research at Google) just updated his analysis,
at Mark's request, using a text that contained 3.5 trillion characters to
provide `an updated english letter frequency table <http://norvig.com/mayzner.html>`_.
