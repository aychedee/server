  Shoreditch is a tech hub. I work just by the Old St roundabout and find that
  rumours of it's demise are greatly exaggerated. I like working in and around
  this area. It's great that every night there is a launch party or a technical
  talk about something interesting. A chance to meet people who do similar
  things.

The Shoreditch tech community and Hackney UTC

Shoreditch is a tech hub. I work just by the Old St roundabout and find that
`rumours of it's demise are greatly exaggerated <http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/10/slow-death-of-silicon-roundabout>`_.
I like working in and around this area. It's great that every night there is a
launch party or a technical talk about something interesting. A chance to meet
people who do similar things. Often people have already solved a problem that
you are struggling with and vice versa.
Also, finding people to work with.

Because as your business grows the one thing that you are always going to be
working really hard at is finding people who can help it grow. The industry is
desperate for talented individuals. There are always more ideas for new
products or features than there are people who can make them. Convincing people
that they should be working with you on your problems rather than for someone
else on theirs is always a challenge.

So it was interesting to be invited to give a short talk to the students at `Hackney UTC <http://www.hackneyutc.co.uk/about-us/>`_.

Hackney UTC is a technical college. Intended for kids (ages 14-19) who want to
specialise in digital media, health, and computer science fields. It's just
down the road from the Metric office on Kingsland Road. `The Principal, Catharine Wensley <http://www.hackneyutc.co.uk/about-us/governors/>`_,
is very interested in building relationships with the tech companies who
surround her college. So if that's you, it would be worthwhile to get in touch
with them.

One thing I have noticed when talking to people about programming is that
nobody has a clear idea of what a week on the job might actually involve. Or
they have an idea of what it involves but it's wildly off base. So the 10
minute talk I gave was trying to show what a week in the life of a programmer
involves. By taking them through the process of: `Adding a feature - From concept to deployment, a quick overview (click for slides) <http://www.aychedee.com/p/creating-a-feature/>`_.

Anyway, thanks to Hackney UTC for the opportunity. It really is great to feel
part of a quickly growing community.
