  First blog entry, just an overview of what I want to do.

Hello, World
============

The plan for this blog is to be a technical notepad. The public nature of it 
should force me to be more careful about my writing up things that I have
done in a way that is clear and makes sense to people.  

I am using `rstblog by Armin Ronacher <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog>`_
as publishing tool. Ever since I started using Git in my day to day work I
cannot help but use for everything and have completely embraced the idea of
keeping everything I ever write or create as text files.  

So I can write this blog from anywhere and use git to push it to an AWS server
with a post-recieve hook that builds the static site. Very nice and clean.
