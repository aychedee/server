Lessons from 1 year working with professional programmers
=========================================================

A year ago, one day after coming back from my first Glastonbury, I started
working as a professional programmer. Everything I had worked on before had
been either personal projects or jobs for people I knew. Figuring out how to do
these things had been a matter of internet research and constant
experimentation.

I'm pretty good at teaching myself things. If you aren't I don't think you
could do this job at all. But one thing that you don't get from teaching
yourself is the culture and practices that exist around programming. They are
the things that a self taught individual might look at and think are a massive
waste of time but after a year I now see each one as vital to managing ever
increasing complexity.

So the three main things that I have learnt over the last year are:

1. Being constantly stumped is the job
2. Source control
3. Testing code preserves your sanity
