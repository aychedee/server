  C is a worthwhile language to learn, there are a huge amount of resources
  out there. These are the ones that I have found most helpful. This post will
  continue to be updated. 

Resources for learning the C programming language
=================================================

`The C Programming Language, or "K&R C" <http://torrentz.eu/>`_

The canonical resource for getting started with C, written by it's creators.

`Deconstructing "K&R C" <http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/learn-c-the-hard-waych55.html>`_

A well reasoned critique of K&R C that introduces methods of unit testing in C
and walks through some of the subtle but common bugs to be found in that text.

`Reserved words in C <http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/keywords.html>`_

Simple reference that covers every C keyword. 

`Simple tutorial for pointers in C <http://www.codingunit.com/c-tutorial-how-to-use-pointers>`_

Jumping around memory with straight addition... 

`The GNU Coding Standards <http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html>`_

GNU/Linux is built with C. It is without a doubt that most impressive piece of 
human intellectual collaboration ever. Contributing to it is the reason that I 
want to learn C in the first place.
