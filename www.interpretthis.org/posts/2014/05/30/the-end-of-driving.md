[The end of driving][100]
====================================

**UPDATE 2015/03/23:** *Elon Musk announced yesterday that all Tesla cars will
receive [a software update in about three months that will give them 'autopilot'
capability][5]. This is not truly autonomous cars but it is a self driving car
that will operate on the highway. It is happening even faster than I thought it
would...*

If you make a living driving a car today. You won't in 10 years.

Google's new self driving vehicle prototype is cute, innocuous and undoubtably 
a very good thing. It is going to radically reduce pollution, stop (just completely stop) 
people dying in accidents, and reduce the cost of transport to nothing. 

It's also going to cause social carnage. Driving a vehicle. It's one of the last
reasonably well paid jobs that requires minimal skills. And you get a sense of
freedom. This entire class of jobs is going to vanish, starting in 10 years. That
includes taxi, courier, truck, bus, train, delivery, etc. You know: DRIVERS.

Above are some French taxi drivers protesting Uber. They're worried about a 
company coming in and lowering their wages. Wait until the other shoe drops and
they realise that [Uber in the future won't need them at all][0]. Ouch.

Who is going to get rich off this? Google, obviously, and whatever companies 
license the technology and manufacture the vehicles. Google will probably follow
the same model (though not actually *paying* companies to use it) they used with
Android. They let anyone make self driving cars following their guidelines.

The manufacturers won't necessarily be current auto companies either. Samsung or LG
are just as likely to make these things as Toyota or Ford. Because they will be radically 
different. You don't need crumple zones, engines, or air bags  in an electric 
car that will never hit anything. It's just 4 wheels, lots of batteries, and an
[AC motor][1]. And a computer of course. 

We better start thinking about a [basic income][2] quick because that's a whole 
lot more dudes (most drivers are men) who will be coming onto the labour market
all of a sudden.

So why is it still a good thing? 

1. Because global warming. Cheaper solar power and replacing the entire vehicle
   fleet with robotic electric vehicles is going to be super efficient. Cars
   parked on the side of the road? That's just wasted capacity when they could
   be out there earning you money by working as a taxi. So cars will be much 
   more environmentally friendly and we won't need as many. 

2. Deaths. [1.2 million people died in accidents last year][3]. That's a holocaust 
   every 5 years. Guns don't kill people. People driving cars kill people. Driverless
   cars will never have an accident. The only way you'll get injured in a driverless 
   car is if some drunk luddite in a Jaguar deliberately drives into you.

3. Transport is going to be cheap and convenient. A $5,000 vehicle that can 
   be out on the street working 24 hours a day (with a few charging breaks) will
   pay itself off very quickly. And then ruthless price competition will mean 
   companies like Uber charging a thin profit margin over the cost of the
   electricity to run them. Getting a taxi could end up cheaper than current 
   public transport costs. And buses might just become a public good. 

It is going to be a massive social change. Probably the biggest since the original
Model T came onto the scene 102 years ago and we all went nuts for cars. When
it happens it is going to happen really fast. The economics just make so
much sense. [Hello JohnnyCab!][4]
