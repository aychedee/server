[Whatever happened to baby IE?][100]
====================================

[Internet Explorer is maturing into a real browser][0]. I went to a Microsoft 
sponsored event the other night and was amused to see the marketing team 
wearing their "[We have standards!][1]" t-shirts. Great! Welcome to the
party. We do hope you will enjoy yourselves...

Internet Explorer was originally written to compete with (and destroy) a 
[competing application on the Microsoft platform][3]. Microsoft did not care about 
the web page as a medium or the web browser as a piece of technology. But they
would be damned if they would let another company own such an important piece
of infrastructure on their platform. 

Once they won the [first browser war][2] they moved on and stopped caring. It
would be **5 years and 2 months** after the release of IE6 that Microsoft
released IE7.

2014, the present day. Microsoft is no longer defending applications on 
its platform against interlopers. Instead it is desperately trying to stop its
platform from going away. It is so concerned about being able to sell 
*something* to the users of the platforms of the future (Android, and iOS) that 
it just took the drastic step of [releasing Office on them][4]. 

But what will become of Internet Explorer? Chrome and Firefox are cross
platform browsers. They have been designed to work consistently anywhere. IE is
the opposite. Heavily tied to Windows APIs. It would be a herculean effort to 
port it. And what would motivate anyone to do the huge amount of work needed to
port IE12+ to any other platforms? Why would anyone want it? Are you going to 
install IE13 on your Android tablet?

Microsoft obviously need a browser on *their* tablets. If only to defend
against Google owning them completely. But does it need to develop one itself?
Does it need to develop the rendering engine itself? 

No, I think IE is finished. It will die alone on [the burning platform][5]
that is Desktop windows.[^1] There might be something called Internet Explorer in
the future. But it will be a skin over an open source rendering engine. And it
will *finally* have standards. Despite all the best efforts of Microsoft it is
still not a browser that people want to use. It is a browser that people use if
they do not know any better. Which was how they won the first browser war. In
April 2014 IE (all versions) has 23% of users. While Chrome now has 44%. On
mobile, the future, [they have nothing. A mere 2%][6]. A statistical blip.

Exactly right Blanche. But, thankfully, in 2014 nobody[^2] is stuck in that
chair anymore. 

**UPDATE 22/01/2015**: [MicroSoft are indeed creating a new browser][9], and
throwing away the IE rendering engine. Though still persisting in writing it
themselves. It is a break with the past in that they are not attempting to make
this backwards compatible. Phew!

 [^1]: Okay, that is a bit hyperbolic. [Microsoft will always be with us, like
    IBM][8]. But the brief technology environment blip that allowed it to take 
    over the world is finished. 

 [^2]: Yeah yeah, I am aware that legacy business customers exist, and I feel
    just as sorry for them as they feel for themselves.
