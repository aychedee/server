The terror of a pre bombing warning
===================================

I have seen a particular message being repeated across the internet in 
comment sections over the last couple of days. 

The essential claim is that the IDF/Israel warns the inhabitants of Gaza (via
air dropped leaflets) up to 24 hours before attacking. This claim is conflated
with Israel's own air strike early warning system. In fact I saw it claimed
that it was easier for people in Gaza because they had 24 hours rather than 20
seconds warning. 20 seconds being the aproximate time that a missile will hit
after the air raid sirens go off. 

To a reasonable person that might seem like the humanitarian thing to do. The 
IDF only strikes at military targets and they warn the civilians in the area 
well in advance that such a strike is going to occur. Wonderful!

However it makes no sense if you think about it for more than a few seconds. 

Consider the general area that they would have to warn the population about.
The danger zone if you will. Say for instance that the IDF had heard that some
Hamas militants were using a particular building. They obviously wouldn't give
just that building a warning. They aren't interested in blowing up empty
buildings. They want to kill people. 

Okay, so maybe they give the block a warning. Again, still too specific. Any 
military targets would just move out and find somewhere else to operate from. 

Ultimately if every time the IDF dropped *warnings* in a neighbourhood, that
area was then reduced to rubble 24 hours later. Then yes. People would move. 
Including the people they were trying to target. So if the IDF is dropping 
warnings then they must be extremely vague and cover vast areas. Probably
terrifying things to receive. But not containing any information that you could
use. 

When you consider this, the dropping of leaflets (warning you that 
some part of the city you live in is going to be blown up within 24 hours)
starts sounding less humanitarian and more terrifying.
