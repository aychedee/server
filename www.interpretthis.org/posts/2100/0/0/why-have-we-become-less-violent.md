Why have we become less violent?
================================

So before I lay out the question I should mention that I do not know the
answer. There are a lot of competing theories and they could all be
contributing factors.

So, why have we become less violent? 

First off many people are not aware that violent crime has been plummeting for 
the last few years. You do not generally get this impression from the media 
since there is still a huge amount of horrible stuff for them to report on. But
per capita all categories of violent crime are just dropping off a cliff.

Looking at the graph in this article, I wondered if it was that it had become
harder to have an econonomically viable criminal lifestyle. Looking at how much
car theft had dropped. If stealing stuff stopped being a career choice maybe it
had a knock on effect to other crimes?
