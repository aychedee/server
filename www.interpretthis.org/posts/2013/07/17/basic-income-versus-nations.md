Basic income versus nations
===========================

A basic income is a response to the idea that modern society can no longer 
provide a viable\* job for every member.


As this [Great Recession][0] grinds on with no real end in site and 
[very large problems looming][1] the [conversation about a basic income][2] has 
been bubbling up and the [structural reasons why we might need one][3] being 
gone over.

The argument can be simplified to this. 

 * As we [automate production humans stop being required][4]
 * We now realise that everything can be automated, not just manufacturing

Then it branches off down two paths

Either, 

 * for an economy to exist and not collapse it needs consumers, and consumers
need income. 

**or**

 * We do not really care about the economy, but it would be nice if people could 
live with a bit of dignity and make our society healthier overall.

So, you get to pick whichever one you find more compelling. 

I think the idea of a basic income is great. Probably necessary. But I have no 
idea how it could be implemented piecemeal around the world without failing horribly. 

Countries do not exist in isolation. Would a country with a basic income have 
to close its borders? Or would it have openish borders but make becoming a 
citizen incredibly hard? But doing that would would negate the whole point of a 
basic income in the first place. 

It is a great idea that is probably doomed to fail until we have some kind of 
global governance structure in place.
