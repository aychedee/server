===============================

A few months ago, walking down the road from the bus stop to my office in the 
the April snow I had a "fuck me this is actually happening" moment in regards

The big problem with stopping climate change is that it is absolutely out of the
control of any one country. Even any one group of countries. And any countries that 
don't take part in stopping it are going to get a big free ride from those that 
do. In this way there is no incentive for individual states (with short term political calendars)
to do anything about it. 

Fuck me. We need a world government.
