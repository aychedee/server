The big one
===========

The recession which started in 2007 is still grinding on in 2013. [Calculated 
Risk recently updated his US payroll projection graph][0] and I have included it

One of the striking things about this chart is the different shapes of the 
three last recessions. These three recessions (1990, 2001, 2007) have been
vociferously fought with a zero rate interest policy. And you can see that it 
does actually work for 1990. The recession is a bit longer but it is much 
shallower. Then in 2001 it again makes the recession shallower. But at the cost
of making it twice as long as any preceding post war recession. Can it really be
said to have worked? Now 2007. The monetary policies set in place for the 2001
recession never actually went away. It is clear that this recession is so much
deeper and and longer lasting than anything but the [Great Depression][1].
