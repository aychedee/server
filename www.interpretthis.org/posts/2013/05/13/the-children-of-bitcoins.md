The Children of Bitcoin
=======================

Whether or not Bitcoin suceeds as a currency or a viable store of value is 
unimportant now. As a proof of concept it has already worked. People now accept
that you can have a decentralised, anonymous wealth registry. Because behind
all the cryptography that is all it is. A mutually agreed upon list of 
transactions that we all accept. Or all will accept eventually.

So something might go wrong with this particular piece of software. The 
very algorithm itself might not scale well. [It is already creaking a bit under
the current transaction load](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/185a91/is_bitcoin_prepared_for_10000_transactions_every/). 
But the concept itself will not go away. 

In fact the only thing that will replace Bitcoin is a better version. It is one
of those technologies that will change the way we do a lot of things and it 
is very interesting to watch it develop and even more interesting to watch the
variant descendents develop. None of the variants are currently more 
interesting than the original [but you can keep an eye on them here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_alternative_cryptocurrencies).

One fascinating side effect of these new crypto currencies is that we finally 
have direct monetary competition. People can vote with their wallets on which 
*type* of currency they prefer. Will people choose to use a deflationary 
currency for day to day transactions but hold their wealth in a inflation proof
store of wealth? Which will be the first government to start accepting tax 
payments in a decentralised currency? And when will Western Union curl up and
die?
