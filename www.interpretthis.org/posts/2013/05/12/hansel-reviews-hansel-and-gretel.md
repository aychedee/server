Hansel reviews Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters
==============================================

Things I liked about this film:

 * Brooms sound and handle like [imperial speeder bikes](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike)
 * They made [a real animatronic troll head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_WXotDNr-E)

On the other hand there are some things to feel weird about it.

It is strange to watch a modern movie about burning witches which is so 
gung ho about the enterprise. Woman really were accused of being witches and 
tortured, killed, and burnt. When I started thinking about *that* it began to
feel like watching some anti-witch propoganda piece that a particular clever
pope might have authorised. 

Having said that, it was one of the more fun movies of 2013. The whole thing 
is played with a camp pitch that carries the film along.
