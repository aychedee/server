Pre pay media culture
=====================

The current media model for funding multimillion dollar productions is one
where conglomerates ([Sony, Time Warner, Disney, Comcast, News Corp, Fox,
Viacom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_film_studio)) decide on projects and
fund them. One way of looking at them is as very specialised investment
companies. 

Sony Pictures is the biggest with 17% of the market. In 2013 (year ending
March) they had a revenue of [$4.7 billion and an operating income of $396](http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/financial/fr/12q4_sony.pdf)
million. Which means they spent $4.3 billion to create this years entertainment
output. 

So if the figures are about the same for the rest of the majors we could, very
roughly, estimate that it cost the majors $25 billion to make their combined 
output of film and television for the last year. 

Kickstarter, in the entire time it has existed, has raised [$611 million](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats).
and only [$100 million so far has gone to back films](http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/100-million-pledged-to-independent-film). 

So Kickstarter has a long way to go before it can replace the entire investment
out of the majors. But it does look like the beginning of something. 

And that something might be a culture that the consumers pay for in advance.
As opposed to a studio investment system that churns out a speculative product.
there might be production teams that make something that people have already
bought a ticket for. 

It neatly side steps the content piracy issue as well. If the product has already
been paid for pre-production then who cares really? Just release it to the 
creative commons. You don't need a distribution deal. Just tell your backers 
where to find the torrent.
