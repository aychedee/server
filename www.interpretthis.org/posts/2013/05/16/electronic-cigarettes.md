Electronic cigarettes, seem legit
=================================

I have smoked cigarettes since I was 16. Over the last 24 years you could say 
that I have mostly pretended to not be addicted to them. But the pretense is 
false. I stopped getting any real pleasure out of them years ago, I am not a
masochist, and yet I still buy packet after packet of a expensive and
dangerous product.

That is the only reason it has taken so long to try out one of the, reasonably,
new electronic cigarettes. Buying one was an admission that I was actually a
smoker and actually hopelessly addicted to cigarettes. 

Over the last two weeks I have been using a [purely disposable model][0]. And it has 
worked. For the first time in a long time I have gone an entire week and boozy
weekend without smoking any actual cigarettes.

So the irony now is that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
has performed a public consultation and decided that ["there is clear support for
MHRA regulation, including from medical professional bodies, royal colleges, 
NHS bodies, public health bodies and trading standards."][1]

Nobody seems to be arguing that electronic cigarettes are not *much* safer for
people than tobacco. But it seems that a broad range of medical professionals 
want them regulated like a medicine. Why exactly? They are clearly not a
medicine. Or at least the people using them are not really *trying* to quit. 
They are using them to replace cigarettes. Regulate them like tobacco if you
have to. But it seems absurd to make a safer alternative harder to get when you
can still buy a pack of cigarettes in every corner store.

Sure, the idea of allowing a new, highly addictive, consumer product onto the
market probably seems appalling to lots of people. But you have to put it into
the context of the existing special case that tobacco represents.

The final decision on regulation should be coming out soon (scheduled for 
Spring 2013) but it seems inevitable that the MHRA will do something. And that 
something will make the safer alternative more expensive and harder to get than
tobacco.
